In 2020, I decided I needed a hobby that I could participate in from home. I ended up finding the world of flight sim and have immersed into it. After about three months I started to lose interest but then found an online community of flight simmers at twitch.tv. I have been hanging out with this community ever since. In June 2021 I decided to join a virtual airline. It gave me something to work towards. I recently completed 1,000 hours in VATSIM.
